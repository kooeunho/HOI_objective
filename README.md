Abstract

In the node classification task, it is intuitively understood that densely connected nodes tend to exhibit similar attributes. However, it is crucial to first define what constitutes a dense connection and to develop a reliable mathematical tool for assessing node cohesiveness. In this paper, we propose a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks’ capabilities. The proposed function embodies the philosophy most aligned with the intuition behind classifying within higher order networks, as it is designed to reduce the likelihood of nodes interconnected through higher-order networks bearing different labels. Additionally, we propose the Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM) as a graph generation model designed specifically to address a significant limitation of the traditional stochastic block model, which does not adequately represent the distribution of higher-order structures in real networks. We evaluate the objective function using networks generated by the SBTM, which include both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Furthermore, we present an approach that integrates the objective function with graph neural network (GNN)-based semi-supervised node classification methodologies, aiming for additional performance gains. Our results demonstrate that in challenging classification scenarios—characterized by a low probability of homo-connections, a high probability of hetero-connections, and limited prior node information—higher-order network models surpass pairwise interactions in objective function performance. Moreover, experimental results have confirmed that integrating our proposed objective function with existing GNN-based node classification methodologies enhances classification performance through the effective learning of higher-order structures distributed within the network.
